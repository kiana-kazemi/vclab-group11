## Description: 
Our program asks the user for their name and to pick between 5 majors that interest them. Then, the system prints out a statement that tells the user which college has the best program for their major. 

## License:
The license that we picked is the Eclipse Public License. This License has a copylefted modification and distribution agreement. This means that the copyright owner for this license allows other people to modify and distribute the code with specific restricitons. This is good for our project becayse we want other users to be able to add majors and colleges that they may want to see in the program, however, we don't want them to completely change the sturcture of the program itself.
