Description: Our program asks the user for their name and to pick between 5 majors that interest them. Then, the system prints out a statement that tells the user which college has the best program for their major. 

The license that we picked is the Eclipse Public License. This License has a copylefted modification and distribution agreement. This means that the copyright owner for this license allows other people to modify and distribute the code with specific restricitons.
